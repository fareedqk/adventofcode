## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual event that features a series of programming challenges that are released daily from December 1st to December 25th. Each challenge consists of two parts, with the second part building upon the first. The puzzles are designed to be solvable in any programming language, making them accessible to a wide range of developers.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by year and day:

```
adventofcode/
│
├── 2024/
│   ├── day01/
│   │   ├── 1.py 
|   |   |── 2.py
│   │   └── input.txt
│   ├── day02/
│   │   ├── 1.py
|   |   |── 2.py
│   │   └── input.txt
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

Each day's folder contains:
- `1.py & 2.py`: The code that solves the puzzle for that day.
- `input.txt`: The input data used for testing the solution.

## Languages Used

The solutions are primarily written in Python, but you may find implementations in other languages as well. Feel free to explore and adapt the solutions in your preferred language!

## How to Run the Solutions

To run the solutions locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fareedqk/adventofcode.git
   cd adventofcode/2024/day01
   ```

2. Install any necessary dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the solution:
   ```bash
   python solution.py < input.txt
   ```

Make sure to replace `day01` with the appropriate day folder for other solutions.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a solution or improvement, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. Please ensure that your code is well-documented and adheres to the project's coding standards.
